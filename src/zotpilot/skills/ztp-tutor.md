# Deep Reading Guide (五维导读)

## Language Policy

Two independent languages:

- **Interface language** — detect from the triggering message; use it for every
  user-facing chat message.
- **Annotation language** — the language of the in-PDF `comment` fields AND the
  page-1 overview. It follows the reader's persona (Step 2a): use the reader's
  stated native / preferred annotation language. When the persona indicates no
  language, default to Chinese.

The annotation language is independent of the paper's language — the goal is to
explain a (often foreign-language) paper in the reader's own language. Carry the
chosen language on the overview via its `lang` field (`"zh"`, `"en"`, …) so the
page-1 overview labels render in the same language (Step 5).

---

## Step 1 — Resolve the paper

Call `get_paper_for_tutor(title_or_doc_id)` with the title or item key the
user provided.

**If the response contains `needs_disambiguation: true`**, the tool found
multiple candidates. Present them as a numbered list showing `doc_id`,
`title`, `authors`, and `year`. Then ask exactly one question and stop:

> 找到多篇匹配的论文，请告诉我你想导读哪一篇（回复编号）：
>
> 1. [doc_id] 《title》— authors (year)
> 2. …

Wait for the user to pick a single item, then call `get_paper_for_tutor`
again with the selected `doc_id`. Do not proceed until exactly one paper is
confirmed.

**If the tool raises a ToolError** mentioning "no text layer" or "scanned",
tell the user that this PDF has no embedded text layer and OCR is needed
before the reading guide can be written. Stop here.

**If the tool raises any other ToolError**, surface the message verbatim and
stop.

---

## Step 2 — Read the persona and existing annotations

The response from Step 1 carries two personalization inputs:

### 2a. Persona (`persona: string | null`)

The raw text of the `## 阅读画像 (Reading Persona)` section from
`~/.config/zotpilot/ZOTPILOT.md`, or `null` if absent.

**Parse by intent-matching, not literal enum.** The persona is stored as
labeled lines (`英文水平：…`, `领域熟悉度：…`, …), so match each axis by its
LABEL first: a bare token like `入门` means English-beginner under `英文水平`
but field-novice under `领域熟悉度` — never let one token set an axis it was not
labeled for. Match leniently within each labeled value:

**English proficiency — gates the term + long-sentence layer:**
Match any of: `英文弱`, `英文不好`, `英文一般`, `入门`, `中等`, `poor`,
`intermediate`, `beginner`, `basic`, `不太好`, `一般般`.
If any such pattern appears, treat English proficiency as "weak" and ENABLE
the term and long-sentence annotation layers.
If the raw text says `高级`, `expert`, `advanced`, `proficient`, or similar
strength signals, treat English proficiency as "strong" and SUPPRESS those
layers entirely.
When no match is found, default to "moderate" and SUPPRESS those layers
(conservative default: do not add extra layers unless clearly warranted).

**Reading depth — gates annotation density:**
- `速览` / `quick read` / `overview` / `skim` → sparse: thesis claim + key
  figures + 1–2 annotations per present dimension.
- `技术细节` / `technical` / `detailed` / `in-depth` / `深度` → standard:
  fuller coverage of method, evidence, and proof steps.
- `全面综述` / `comprehensive` / `thorough` / `全面` / `详尽` → maximal:
  annotate every independent understanding point within the hard caps.

When hints conflict (e.g., `速览` but `新手`), favor the MORE CONSERVATIVE
density to avoid over-annotation.

When depth cannot be recognized, default to `速览`.

**Annotation language — sets the language of every in-PDF comment + overview:**
Match a stated native / preferred language, e.g. `母语：英文`, `批注语言：中文`,
`用英文批注`, `native language: English`, `annotate in English`. Use that
language for all `comment` fields and the page-1 overview, and set the overview
`lang` accordingly (Step 5). When no language is stated, default to Chinese
(`zh`). This is independent of English proficiency — a reader may want English
annotations yet still need the term / long-sentence layers, or vice versa.

**Reading purpose — reallocates emphasis across the five dimensions (it does NOT
raise the annotation count):** match the reader's intent and steer the limited
budget toward the points that serve it:
- 入门 / 背景 / `background` / 了解 → emphasize `thesis`, `concept`, big-picture
  significance and `conclusion`; go lighter on method internals.
- 复现 / 实现 / `implement` / `reproduce` / 跑代码 → emphasize `method`,
  equations, experimental setup and any hyperparameters; the method section is
  the priority surface.
- 评审 / 审稿 / 批判 / `review` / `critique` → emphasize claim↔evidence links,
  `rebuttal` / limitations, methodology soundness and unstated assumptions;
  call out weak or unsupported claims explicitly.
- 找结果 / 特定问题 / `specific finding` → emphasize the `evidence` (tables /
  figures) bearing on the reader's question; lighter elsewhere.
- 综述 / 定位 / `survey` / `positioning` → emphasize `thesis`, the contribution,
  relation to prior work and `conclusion`.
If the triggering message states a purpose for THIS paper (e.g. 「我想复现它的
方法」), use it for this run, overriding any persona default. When no purpose is
given anywhere, default to a balanced five-dimension reading.

*Example:* with purpose `复现` on a method paper, most of the budget goes to
`method` + equations + setup while `rebuttal` keeps only its one required note;
with purpose `评审` on the same paper, the budget shifts instead to
claim↔evidence gaps and limitations.

**Domain familiarity — sets how much background each comment carries:**
- 新手 / 入门 / `novice` / 不熟 → comments add orienting context: what a term
  builds on, why a result matters, how it fits the field; define field jargon
  even when English proficiency is strong.
- 熟悉 / 专家 / `expert` / `familiar` → skip basics; focus comments on what is
  novel, the specific contribution, and where the work is weak or surprising.
- Default (中等 / unstated): explain non-obvious constructs but not textbook basics.

**Comment style — shapes how each `comment` reads (not what is covered):**
- 结构化 / 要点 / `bullet` / `structured` → terse, label-led notes
  (`论点：…` / `证据：…`), one idea per comment.
- 叙述 / `narrative` / `prose` → short flowing prose, 1–2 sentences.
- 提问 / `socratic` / 启发 → end with a brief check question that nudges the
  reader to connect the point to the argument.
- Default: clear explanatory prose.

**If `persona` is `null`:**

First **infer, don't interrogate**. Take whatever the reader already signaled in
the triggering message as given and do NOT re-ask it — e.g. 「我想复现这篇的
方法」→ purpose=复现; 「用英文批注」→ language=en; 「我是这领域新手」→
familiarity=novice.

Then offer a low-friction quick-start (one short message, then wait) — a stated
default plan plus an open invitation, NOT a six-field form:

> 还没有你的阅读画像，我可以直接开始：默认 **中文批注 · 速览 · 均衡覆盖五维**。
> 想更贴合你，任选一项告诉我即可（其余用默认）：
> · 阅读目的：入门 / 复现 / 评审 / 找结果 / 综述
> · 批注语言 · 英文水平 · 领域熟悉度 · 导读深度 · 风格偏好（要点 / 叙述 / 提问）
> 直接回「开始」就用默认。

Accept partial answers — a one-word reply like 「复现」 or 「开始」 is enough;
fill every unstated axis with the default and never block on a full profile.

**Persist the stable traits** the reader states (批注语言 / 英文水平 /
领域熟悉度 / 导读深度 / 风格偏好) so future runs don't re-ask: call
`save_reading_persona(persona_text=...)` with one labeled markdown line per
stated axis, e.g.:

```
- 批注语言：中文
- 英文水平：入门
- 领域熟悉度：中等
- 导读深度：速览
- 风格偏好：结构化要点
```

It writes the `## 阅读画像 (Reading Persona)` section to
`~/.config/zotpilot/ZOTPILOT.md`; confirm the save (the tool returns
`{saved, path, action}`). Reading **purpose** is per-paper — use it for this run
from the trigger or the quick-start reply, and persist it as a default only when
the reader frames it as a standing preference. If the reader replies 「开始」 or
「跳过」, proceed on defaults (Chinese annotations · sparse · balanced five
dimensions · English-proficiency moderate · moderate familiarity · plain prose)
and do not ask again this run.

### 2b. Existing annotations (`existing_annotations: list`)

The list of foreign (non-ZotPilot) annotations already in the PDF. Read it
as a personalization signal:

- Treat pages with more than 2 foreign annotation spans as already heavily
  covered by the user. Reduce proposed annotations on those pages — skip
  claims or spans the user has already highlighted.
- Do NOT propose any annotation whose quote clearly overlaps a foreign
  highlight on the same page. The code enforces an IoU > 0.5 rejection gate;
  be courteous and pre-skip obvious overlaps at this planning stage.
- Foreign annotations on a page do NOT block the five-dimension coverage
  entirely — aim to cover remaining independent understanding points around
  the user's existing work.

---

## Step 3 — Produce the annotation list from `page_texts`

Read `page_texts` (the list of `{page_num, text}` objects, one per page).
This is the primary reading surface for annotation planning — use it rather
than `sectioned_text` alone, because `page_texts` supplies the `page_num`
values that become `page_hint` in every annotation spec.

Produce a compact Prompt-B annotation list. Hard rules:

**Five dimensions — cover every dimension the paper actually has:**
- `thesis` — 核心论点 (the central claim the paper defends)
- `concept` — 关键概念 (a key term, definition, or theoretical construct)
- `evidence` — 实证证据 (empirical result, experiment, or supporting data)
- `rebuttal` — 让步反驳 (limitation, counter-argument, or scope boundary)
- `method` — 方法论 (a methodological choice, algorithm step, or design decision)

For each dimension that the paper genuinely contains, produce at least one
annotation. Skip a dimension only when the paper truly lacks it (e.g., a
purely theoretical paper with no empirical section has no `evidence`).
Never duplicate-color the same text span across two dimensions.

**Personalize within the budget (Step 2a) — reallocate, don't inflate:**
- **Reading purpose** reallocates emphasis: keep each present dimension's one
  required annotation, then spend the remaining budget on the dimensions the
  purpose emphasizes and trim de-emphasized ones to their minimum.
- **Domain familiarity** sets how much background each `comment` carries
  (novice → orienting context; expert → novelty + critique).
- **Comment style** sets how each `comment` is phrased (structured / narrative
  / Socratic).
These shape the SAME annotations and respect the Step 6 density ceiling.

**Per-annotation fields:**
```
{
  quote:      the verbatim excerpt from the paper text (≤ 1000 bytes UTF-8),
  dimension:  one of the five keys above,
  comment:    per-sentence understanding note in the annotation language (≤ 500 bytes UTF-8),
  page_hint:  the page_num of the page where this quote appears (1-based),
  kind:       "highlight" for all prose/term/equation/caption annotations,
              "region"    for figure and materialized-table region notes,
  subtype:    one of: dim | term | long_sentence | figure | figure_caption |
                      table | equation   (informational; drives coverage report),
  page:       required when kind="region" — copy verbatim from figures[]/tables[],
  bbox:       required when kind="region" — copy verbatim from figures[]/tables[]
}
```

**Hard byte caps enforced at the tool boundary:**
- `comment` ≤ 500 bytes (UTF-8)
- `quote` ≤ 1000 bytes (UTF-8)
- Total annotations ≤ 200
- `overview` total ≤ 2000 bytes

Never reproduce large blocks of text. Compact list only.

---

## Step 4 — Emit MIXED-kind annotation specs

Cover all element types. For each element type below, follow the exact
mechanism — the `kind`, `subtype`, and source of coordinates are not
judgment calls.

### 4a. Five-dimension prose claims
- `kind="highlight"`, `subtype="dim"`, `dimension` = the matching key.
- `quote` is the verbatim sentence or clause that carries the claim.
- `page_hint` = the `page_num` from `page_texts` where the quote appears.
- Do not invent a `page` or `bbox` field on highlight annotations.

### 4b. 关键术语 (English-proficiency weak only)
- Only emit when Step 2a determined English proficiency is "weak".
- `kind="highlight"`, `subtype="term"`, `dimension="concept"`.
- Short quote of the term itself (≤ 40 characters preferred).
- `comment` = brief gloss in the annotation language: what the term means in this paper's context.
- `page_hint` from the page where the term first appears.

### 4c. 长难句 (English-proficiency weak only)
- Only emit when Step 2a determined English proficiency is "weak".
- `kind="highlight"`, `subtype="long_sentence"`, `dimension="method"` or
  `"concept"` as appropriate.
- Quote the full difficult sentence (≤ 200 characters preferred).
- `comment` = grammar skeleton + a translation into the annotation language, in natural prose.
- `page_hint` from the page where the sentence appears.

### 4d. 图 Figure
For EVERY entry in `figures[]` (all are guaranteed to have `bbox` and
`caption` from the extractor):

**Region note** (the primary anchor at the figure):
- `kind="region"`, `subtype="figure"`.
- `page` = `figure.page_num` — copy verbatim, do not edit.
- `bbox` = `figure.bbox` — copy the four-element list verbatim, do not edit
  or synthesize coordinates. Never compute, estimate, or modify a bbox.
- `dimension` = `"evidence"` (figures are usually evidence or method; use
  your judgment but do not leave blank).
- `comment` = figure 导读: one or two sentences (in the annotation language)
  describing what this figure shows and why it matters to the argument.
- Leave `quote` as an empty string `""` for region notes.

**Caption highlight** (secondary anchor on the caption text):
- `kind="highlight"`, `subtype="figure_caption"`.
- `quote` = the caption text from `figure.caption` (the full caption string,
  truncated to 1000 bytes if needed).
- `page_hint` = `figure.page_num`.
- `comment` = same brief 导读 as the region note, or a complementary note.
- If the caption text is very short (< 12 chars), omit the caption highlight
  and keep only the region note.

### 4e. 表 Table

**If the table is in `tables[]`** (materialized, bbox present):
- Emit a region note exactly as in §4d, using `table.bbox`, `table.page_num`,
  `subtype="table"`.
- Also emit a caption highlight for `table.caption` with `subtype="table"`,
  `page_hint=table.page_num`. If caption is null or very short, omit the
  caption highlight.

**If a page has `tables_on_page[page_num] > 0` but no entry in `tables[]`**
(detected but not materialized — no bbox available):
- Emit a text-anchored highlight on the caption text or the nearest "Table N"
  label you can locate in `page_texts`, `subtype="table"`, `kind="highlight"`.
- If no caption or "Table N" text can be found in the page text, emit
  nothing for this table. It will appear in `unplaced` as
  `unanchorable_table`.
- NEVER synthesize a `bbox` for a table that is not in `tables[]`.

### 4f. 公式 Equation
- Use `kind="highlight"`, `subtype="equation"`.
- Quote the SPECIFIC explanatory sentence that describes or derives the
  equation (the prose adjacent to the equation, not the equation glyphs
  themselves). Choose a sentence ≥ 12 characters.
- `comment` = an explanation, in the annotation language, of what the equation
  means and how it connects to the argument.
- Do NOT use `kind="region"` for equations — there is no extractor bbox.
- If the explanatory sentence is ambiguous (appears more than once on the
  page), the code will report `ambiguous_multi_match`. In that case, try a
  longer surrounding sentence that is unique.

---

## Step 5 — Build the `overview` dict

Construct a compact argument-structure map for the page-1 sticky-note:

```json
{
  "lang":      "zh|en|… — the annotation language from Step 2a (drives overview labels)",
  "thesis":    "核心论点，一句话",
  "skeleton": {
    "question":   "研究问题",
    "claim":      "主要论点",
    "evidence":   "关键证据",
    "rebuttal":   "让步/局限",
    "conclusion": "结论"
  },
  "strongest": "最有力的论据",
  "weakest":   "最薄弱的环节"
}
```

All text fields in the annotation language (set `lang` to match), short phrases. Total JSON serialized to ≤ 2000 bytes.

---

## Step 6 — Apply density rules ("满秩 but just-right")

Before calling `annotate_pdf`, review the full annotation list against the
density rules:

- **Span every independent understanding point** — each annotation should
  add a piece of understanding that the others do not already cover.
- **No redundancy** — if two annotations say the same thing about the same
  span, remove one.
- **Scale to persona depth:**
  - `速览`: thesis + key figures + 1–2 per present dimension + terms/sentences
    if English-weak. Aim for 8–20 total annotations for a typical paper.
  - `技术细节`: fuller method/evidence coverage. Aim for 20–50.
  - `全面综述`: every independent point. Up to the 200-annotation cap.
- **On conflicts** between persona signals (e.g., "速览" but "新手"), always
  choose the MORE CONSERVATIVE density.
- **Heavily annotated pages** (user has > 2 foreign annotations on the page):
  drop redundant annotations on that page, but do not skip all annotations.

The code enforces M3 caps (`comment` ≤ 500 B, `quote` ≤ 1000 B, ≤ 200
annotations, `overview` ≤ 2000 B) at the tool boundary. Stay well within
them — these are hard rejection limits, not soft suggestions.

---

## Step 7 — Pre-skip obvious overlaps with user annotations

Review `existing_annotations` one more time before the final list:

- If a planned quote clearly covers the same span as a user's existing
  highlight on the same page (obvious overlap), drop the planned annotation.
  The code enforces an IoU > 0.5 rejection gate and will record it as
  `user_already_annotated`; pre-skipping avoids a cluttered unplaced report.
- Partial overlaps (e.g., user highlighted a short term; you are highlighting
  the full sentence containing it) are fine — keep the annotation.
- The page-1 overview sticky-note is exempt from this check; it goes in
  regardless of existing annotations on page 1.

---

## Step 8 — Call `annotate_pdf`

**Pass the annotation payload via a file, not inline.** The annotation list is
large; passing it inline as a tool argument produces a cluttered, hard-to-read
approval prompt. Instead:

1. Write the payload to a temp JSON file (use the Write tool), shaped as:
   ```json
   { "annotations": [ ...the final list from Steps 3–7... ],
     "overview":    { ...the dict from Step 5... } }
   ```
   Put it in the OS temp directory so it works on every platform — e.g.
   `$TMPDIR/ztp-tutor-<doc_id>.json` (macOS/Linux) or
   `%TEMP%\ztp-tutor-<doc_id>.json` (Windows). Do NOT hardcode `/tmp`.
2. Call `annotate_pdf` with just:
   ```
   doc_id:     the doc_id from Step 1
   specs_path: the temp JSON file path
   ```
   The approval prompt then shows only the doc_id and the path — the bulky
   content lives in the file (reviewable as a normal, collapsible file diff).

Only fall back to passing `annotations` + `overview` inline if writing a temp
file is not possible in the environment.

Read the returned dict carefully. It contains:

- `placed`: list of successfully placed annotations
- `unplaced`: list of `{label, reason}` for each annotation that could not
  be placed
- `overview_placed`: bool
- `backup_path`: the `.ztpbak` sidecar path
- `coverage`: breakdown by subtype (figures, tables_region, tables_caption,
  tables_unanchorable, terms, long_sentences, equations)
- `verified`: bool — the post-write verification result
- `summary`: pre-formatted one-line summary (interface language)

---

## Step 9 — Error handling

**`ScannedPdfError` / "no text layer":** Tell the user the PDF lacks an
embedded text layer and OCR is needed. Do not retry.

**`annotate_pdf` raises ToolError:** Surface the message verbatim. If the
error is "backup failed" or "preflight failed", tell the user the PDF was
NOT modified.

**`unplaced` entries:**

| reason | action |
|--------|--------|
| `ambiguous_multi_match` | Try a longer, more unique span from the same sentence; retry the single annotation if possible |
| `too_short` | Note to user — quote was below the 12-char minimum; the code rejected it |
| `no_match` | Note to user — the exact text could not be found in the PDF |
| `user_already_annotated` | Note to user — you already covered this point; skipped to avoid duplication |
| `region_clustered` | The figure/table sticky-note could not find a clear spot near existing annotations; a caption highlight was used instead |
| `unanchorable_table` | No bbox available and no caption text found; the table could not be anchored |
| `page_density_exceeded` | Page already has many annotations; this item was deferred |

For `ambiguous_multi_match`, attempt one retry with a longer surrounding
sentence before reporting it as unplaced.

**`verified: false`:** Tell the user the write verification failed and the
original PDF was restored from `.ztpbak`. No data was lost.

---

## Step 10 — Coverage summary

Relay a concise one-line coverage summary to the user, in the interface language. Build it from
the `coverage` dict and `unplaced` list. Example format:

> 五维齐全 · 5图已标 · 2表（1表仅按标题锚定）· 3术语 · 2长难句 · 备份 foo.pdf.ztpbak · 4处未定位（其中2处用户已批注）

Populate the fields from the actual result:

- **五维** state: list which dimensions are present; if any are missing say
  e.g. `缺 rebuttal`.
- **N图**: number of figures with a placed region note.
- **M表**: breakdown of `tables_region` (region placed) vs `tables_caption`
  (caption-anchor only) vs `tables_unanchorable` (failed).
- **K术语 / J长难句**: from `coverage.terms` and `coverage.long_sentences`.
- **备份 path**: the `backup_path` from the result.
- **X处未定位**: total `len(unplaced)`; break out `user_already_annotated`
  count separately so the user understands their existing annotations were
  respected.

If `overview_placed` is false, note that the page-1 overview note could not
be placed and suggest the user check page 1.

---

## Safety Note

- The original PDF is always backed up to a `.ztpbak` sidecar file **before
  any byte is written**. If anything fails, the original is restored from
  that backup — it is never consumed or deleted by the rollback process.
- Re-running `/ztp-tutor` on the same paper replaces only the ZotPilot
  annotations from the prior run. Foreign annotations (yours or from other
  tools) are never touched, cleared, or counted.
- The `.ztpbak` file persists after a successful run for manual recovery.
  It is safe to delete once you are satisfied with the reading guide.
